### Info
Run checkers game by running Checkers class with arguments, namespace.class1 namespace.class2 options. Supported players are: ui.Human, demo.Random, demo.Demo, advanced.AlphaBeta and advanced.Advanced. Options are not required and they include --turntime integer and --step (click is needed before each turn).


###Advanced player
Advanced players uses alpha beta pruning with complex board evaulation.

```java
/**
 * This is complex static board evaluator for checkers. It combines few heuristic functions. 
 * - H0 simple count evaluation
 * each king on board (not been eaten in the last move) increases the value by 1500.
 * each pawn on board increases the value by 1000
 * 
 * - H1 gives bonus for center control (middle of table) 
 * with H1, 
 * firstly it will be harder to block our pawns, and even harder the kings to a wall, 
 * and secondly, the center of the board will be controlled, we want to control center so we can split 
 * enemy pieces in two groups
 * bonuses are: (in order by columns) 0, 100, 200, 300, 300, 200, 100, 0
 * 
 * - H2 gives bonuses for pawns defending the last line
 * if last line of defense stands back, the enemy player cannot take king
 * last line of defense will move when there is no other pawn to play, or jump by those is needed.
 * bonus is: 500 
 * 
 * - H3 decreases score for every blocked pawn by wall and black figure
 * this gives us more pawns to choose from and advance, every blocked figure lowers the winning chance
 * for every blocked figure -60 (max 7 figures)
 * 
 * - H4 first row has priority - go offense and take queen fast every row - advancing gives bonuses
 * this game cannot be win defensively
 * bonuses are: (in order by row) 0, 900, 750, 600, 450, 300, 150, 0
 * negate bonus for kings, once the king is taken it should go backward
 * 
 * - H5 group movement - every pawn and king more importantly need to have backup piece
 * pawn under attack and no pawn to backup him -700!
 * pawn that has backup behind him +400
 * king under attack and no pawn to backup him -1000!
 * 
 * - H6 number of black pawns and kings (enemy)
 * score decreases for 400 for each black king spawn
 * score increases for 200 for each black pawn that is spawned on the field 
 *
